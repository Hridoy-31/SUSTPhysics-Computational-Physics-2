# SUSTPhysics-Computational-Physics-2
Computational Physics 2 is the second part of two part course which is taught in 4th year 1st semester 
at Department of Physics of Shahjalal University of Science &amp; Technology

Currently 2017-18 Undergraduate Syllabus is being followed.

## Objectives
  * To make efficient in scientific computing
  * To enable us for basic simulation that involves ordinary and partial differential equations
  * To enable us for solving Schrodinger equation numerically

## Course Content
  * Taylor's method
  * Picard's method
  * Euler's method
  * Runge-Kutta methods
  * Boundary value problems
  * Finite difference method
  * Shooting method

## Learning Outcome
  * We will be able to solve initial value problems numerically, solve Runge-Kutta method at higher order corrections,
    solve Boundary value problems numerically, write programs for the initial and boundary value problems numerically
    and write scientific report
